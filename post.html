                <p>
                  After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer
                  Career Path, I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to
                  get expert code reviews of my Solo Projects projects and meet
                  like-minded peers.

                <h3 class="post_h3">How I stay committed to learning</h3>
                <p>
                  I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to
                  spend hours and hours learning, then try to create simple
                  projects using what
                </p>
                <p>
                  I learned or work new techniques into existing projects. While
                  that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I
                  was learning and most things about my journey with the world.
                </p>
                <h3 class="post_h3">How I got started</h3>
                <p>
                  I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site.
                  I would take notes about what I was learning. After each
                  learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what
                  I learned but also write short summaries of what I learned
                  using my own words.
                </p>
                <p>
                  That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that
                  posting my learning summaries was also helping others learn
                  and stay motivated.
